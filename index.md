## Welcome to Statistical Python

The Statistical Python project is a community-driven and community-owned initiative dedicated to building a robust, sustainable ecosystem for statistical software in Python.
Our mission is to unite statisticians, domain practitioners, educators, and software developers to create high-quality, well-engineered statistical tools that empower research, education, and industry.
By fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing, we aim to lower barriers to contribution, promote best practices in software engineering, and ensure that cutting-edge statistical methods are accessible to the broader Python community.

As a domain stack within the larger [Scientific Python project](https://scientific-python.org/), Statistical Python leverages the strengths of the scientific Python ecosystem while addressing the unique needs of the statistical community.
Supported by an NSF POSE Phase I grant, our work focuses on bridging the gap between innovative statistical methodology and modern open-source software development.
Our goal is to catalyze the growth of a vibrant, cross-disciplinary developer and user base, making Python a premier platform for statistical computing and education.
