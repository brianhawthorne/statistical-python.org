# Pilot Projects
-->

As part of our NSF-funded initiative, we are working with two pilot projects that highlight different aspects of the statistical Python ecosystem:

- **[YAGLM](https://github.com/yaglm/yaglm)**: A Python package for generalized linear models, offering modern statistical methodology with various loss functions, regularizers, and solvers.
- **[ISLP](https://github.com/intro-stat-learning/ISLP)**: A companion Python package for the textbook "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python," focused on educational resources and implementations.
